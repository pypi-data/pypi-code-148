README

`setup.py` is only needed for distributing the project as a python package
using `setuptools`.

When developing a python application, the project doesn't need to have `setup.py`
and `setup.cfg`.

Since `python-service` is a package used by other python app as a dependency,
`setup.py` is needed in this project.

See readme in `python_service/service.py` for how to deploy package.
