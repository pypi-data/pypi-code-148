    Declare a FeatureService.

    In Tecton, a Feature Service exposes an API for accessing a set of FeatureViews.
    FeatureServices are implemented using the ``FeatureService`` class.

    Once deployed in production, each model has one associated Feature Service that
    serves the model its features. A Feature Service contains a list of the Feature
    Views associated with a model. It also includes user-provided metadata such as
    name, description, and owner that Tecton uses to organize feature data.
