It supports the following features:\n\n- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management\n- CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)\n- Pre-commit hooks with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)\n- Code quality with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [deptry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry/)\n- Publishing to [Pypi](https://pypi.org) or [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory) by creating a new release on GitHub\n- Testing and coverage with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) and [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)\n- Documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)\n- Compatibility testing for multiple versions of Python with [Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/)\n- Containerization with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n\n---\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/">Documentation</a> - <a href="https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry-example">Example</a> -\n  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter-poetry/">PyPi</a>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\nOn your local machine, navigate to the directory in which you want to\ncreate a project directory, and run the following two commands:\n\n``` bash\npip install cookiecutter-poetry \nccp\n```\n\nAlternatively, install `cookiecutter` and directly pass the URL to this\nGithub repository to the `cookiecutter` command:\n\n``` bash\npip install cookiecutter\ncookiecutter https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry.git\n```\n\nCreate a repository on GitHub, and then run the following commands, replacing `<project-name>`, with the name that you gave the Github repository and\n`<github_author_handle>` with your Github username.\n\n``` bash\ncd <project_name>\ngit init -b main\ngit add .\ngit commit -m "Init commit"\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:<github_author_handle>/<project_name>.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nFinally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with\n\n ```bash\n make install\n ```\n\nYou are now ready to start development on your project! The CI/CD\npipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main,\nor when you create a new release.\n\nTo finalize the set-up for publishing to PyPi or Artifactory, see\n[here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/publishing/#set-up-for-pypi).\nFor activating the automatic documentation with MkDocs, see\n[here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/mkdocs/#enabling-the-documentation-on-github).\nTo enable the code coverage reports, see [here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/codecov/).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project is partially based on [Audrey\nFeldroy\\\'s](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)\\\'s great\n[cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage)\nrepository.\n',
