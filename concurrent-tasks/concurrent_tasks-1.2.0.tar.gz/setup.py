It will have its own event loop.\nUnder the hook, `ThreadSafeTaskPool` is used.\n\nParameters:\n- `name` will be used as the thread\'s name.\n- `size` and `timeout` see `ThreadSafeTaskPool`.\n- `context_manager` can be optional context managers that will be entered when the loop has started\nand exited before the loop is stopped.\n\n> 💡 All tasks will be completed when the pool is stopped.\n\n> 💡 Blocking and async version are the same, prefer the async version if client code is async.\n\n### Blocking\nThis can be used to run async functions in a dedicated event loop, while keeping it running to handle background tasks\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom concurrent_tasks import BlockingThreadedTaskPool\n\n\nasync def func():\n    ...\n\n\nwith BlockingThreadedTaskPool() as pool:\n    # Create and run the task.\n    result = pool.run(func())\n    # Create a task, the `concurrent.Future` will hold information about completion.\n    future = pool.create_task(func())\n```\n\n### Async\nThreads can be useful in cooperation with asyncio to let the OS guarantee fair resource distribution between threads.\nThis is especially useful in case you cannot know if called code will properly cooperate with the event loop.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom concurrent_tasks import AsyncThreadedTaskPool\n\n\nasync def func():\n    ...\n\n\nasync with AsyncThreadedTaskPool() as pool:\n    # Create and run the task.\n    result = await pool.run(func())\n    # Create a task, the asyncio.Future will hold information about completion.\n    future = pool.create_task(func())\n```\n\n## Restartable task\nTask that can be started and cancelled multiple times until it can finally be completed.\nThis is useful to handle pauses and retries when handling with a connection.\n\n> 💡 Use `functools.partial` to pass parameters to the function.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom concurrent_tasks import RestartableTask\n\nasync def send(data): ...\n\ntask: RestartableTask[int] = RestartableTask(partial(send, b"\\x00"), timeout=1)\ntask.start()\nassert await task == 1\n\n# Running in other tasks:\n\n# On connection lost:\ntask.cancel()\n# On connection resumed:\ntask.start()\n# On response received:\ntask.set_result(1)\n```\n',
