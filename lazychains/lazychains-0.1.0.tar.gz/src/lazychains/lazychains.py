class Chain(Generic[T]):
    """
    A chain of items is made up of a singly linked list of Chain records. 
    Each Chain record *either* holds a single item and a pointer to the 
    subsequent chain of items *or* will be an end-of-chain marker *or* 
    holds an iterator that will be run on demand.

    Usually they are less compact than arrays or tuples, which is why they
    are less popular. However their ability to share "tails" can sometimes
    help us avoid unnecessary copying, saving time and store. Also, they can 
    easily represent a large or even infinite sequence that is expanded on 
    demand. Here's a typical idioms showing how to efficiently represent all 
    the lines from a file:

    .. code:: python

        lines = lazychain( open( 'myfile.txt', 'r' ) )
        while lines:
            #
            # Process one or more lines (not shown)
            ...
            lines = lines.tail()

    Note how this idiom 'walks' the chain, overwriting the lines variable 
    so as to allow the Chain records to be swiftly reclaimed by the store
    manager.
    """

    # Implementation note: the _back field is used to represent different 
    # states of the chain. This implementation technique, borrowed from the
    # implementation of dynamic lists in Poplog, requires only 2 fields and
    # has the advantage of overwriting unwanted references to the iterator, 
    # which therefore is released as soon as the chain is fully expanded.
    #
    #   True - this is an unexpanded node with the _front being the iterator
    #   False - this is an expanded _empty_ node, the front is ignored
    #   Chain - this is an expended _nonempty_ node, the front is the value
    #
